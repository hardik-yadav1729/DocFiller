## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions are always welcome! If you would like to contribute to the development of this web extension, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Make the changes you want in your local copy of the repository.
4. Test your changes to make sure they work as expected.

I would recommend `web-ext` for development in Firefox, it significantly decrease development times. Devs can install it using `npm install --global web-ext`.

## Development

1. Make sure you use `yarn` and not `npm` while installing the packages
2. Webpack is configured for the project
3. Do not edit the manifest.json, webpack.config.js files
4. Clone the repo
5. Run `yarn` in the terminal to install the required dependencies
6. Run `yarn dev` to test the extension. A new firefox window will open with the extension loaded.
