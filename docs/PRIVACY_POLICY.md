# **Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date:** Jan 03, 2025

At **docFiller**, we respect your privacy and are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the docFiller browser extension, which helps automatically fill Google Forms using AI language models such as **ChatGPT**, **Anthropic's Claude**, **Gemini**, and **Mistral**.

By using the docFiller extension, you agree to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy and acknowledge that you are bound by the terms of use and privacy policies of the third-party AI services that process your data.

---

## 1. **Data Collection and Usage**

docFiller does **not** collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) remotely. We do collect some basic usage data about your interaction with the extension, but it is stored locally on your system and is **never** sent to any remote servers in any form.

- **Form Data**: The extension works by sending the data from the Google Forms you are filling out (such as questions and answers) to third-party AI services to generate responses. This communication happens entirely through your browser, and **we do not store or access any data** ourselves.
- **AI Model Interaction**: Your data is temporarily processed by the AI model you have selected to assist in filling out the form, but **we do not store or retain** any of this data.
- **Preferences**: Your local extension preferences, including but not limited to API keys, current model, theme, etc., are stored locally on your system.
- **Metrics Data**: To enhance your experience and provide insights, we store certain interaction metrics locally on your device. This includes details such as:
  - Number of forms filled
  - Streaks and active streaks
  - Failure rates
  - Time saved
  - AI interaction statistics (e.g., API calls, response times)

This metrics data is stored locally and is not shared or transmitted externally.

## 2. **How AI Language Models Work**

When you use docFiller, your form data (questions and answers) may be sent to third-party AI language models to generate responses for the form:

- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**
- **Anthropic (Claude)**
- **Google DeepMind (Gemini)**
- **Mistral AI**

These third-party services process your form data temporarily to generate responses. We do not have access to how long these services store or retain data after the response is generated. **We cannot guarantee** whether these third-party AI services retain or store any data after processing, as this is subject to the terms and practices of each provider.

You can review the privacy policies and terms of use for these AI services here:

- [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy) & [Terms of Use](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms)

## 3. **Important Notice About AI Services**

By providing an **API key** for any supported AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, Mistral AI), you **explicitly agree** to that service's **terms of use** and **privacy policy**.

- **Optional Use of AI Services**: Each AI service is **optional** and will only be used if you explicitly provide your own API key for that service and select it as your active model. **No AI service is used by default**. You are not bound by any third-party AI service terms until you choose to use their service by providing an API key.
- **Control Over AI Usage**: You can choose which AI model(s) you wish to use by providing the API key for that specific service. Once provided, the extension will communicate with that selected model to generate responses for your form. You can change or remove your API key at any time.

- **Third-Party Terms**: By using docFiller and providing an API key, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and agree to the **terms of use** and **privacy policies** of the third-party AI services you choose to use.

## 4. **Metrics Data Stored Locally**

To improve functionality and provide insights into your usage, docFiller stores the following metrics locally on your device:

- **Form Metrics**:
  - Total forms filled
  - Successful fills
  - Failed fills
  - Last filled date
  - Current streak and active streak
- **Time Metrics**:
  - Average time saved per form
  - Total hours, minutes, and seconds saved
- **AI Metrics**:
  - API call counts by AI model
  - Token usage by AI model
  - Average response time by AI model
- **Metrics History**:
  - Daily records of forms filled, time saved, and question interaction statistics

This data remains **entirely local** to your device and is not transmitted to any external servers. You can clear this data at any time by accessing the settings in the extension and selecting `Reset Metrics` on the Options page.

## 5. **No Data Retention by docFiller**

docFiller does **not** store any form data, AI responses, or any other data from your interactions with Google Forms. Once the AI models generate a response, **we do not retain** or store that data. It is processed in real-time and discarded after use.

## 6. **No Telemetry or Remote Usage Tracking**

docFiller does **not collect any telemetry** or usage data remotely. We do not track how or when you use the extension, nor do we collect any performance metrics, error logs, or other diagnostic information beyond what is stored locally on your system.

## 7. **User Control and Consent**

- **Control Over Data**: You are always in control of the data you provide in the Google Forms you are filling out. You can choose whether or not to use the docFiller extension at any time.
- **Uninstalling**: If you no longer wish to use the extension, you can uninstall it from your browser at any time. This will stop all interactions with the AI models and prevent any further form filling.

## 8. **Data Security**

Since we do not store any data remotely, we do not need to implement long-term data security measures for the data you enter in forms. However, we do take reasonable precautions to ensure that any data sent between your browser and the third-party AI services is transmitted securely.

Please note that the security practices of the third-party AI services (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Mistral) are governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service. We recommend reviewing those policies to understand how your data is handled by these providers.

## 9. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.
