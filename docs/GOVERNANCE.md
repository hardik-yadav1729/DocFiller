# Project Governance

Welcome to the governance section of our project! This document outlines the governance model and decision-making processes for our project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide transparency and clarity around how decisions are made within our project and the roles and responsibilities of contributors, maintainers, and other stakeholders.

## Decision-Making Process

Our project follows a consensus-seeking decision-making process. This means that decisions are made through discussion and collaboration among project contributors and maintainers, with the goal of reaching consensus whenever possible. Major decisions may be put to a vote among contributors if consensus cannot be reached through discussion alone.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors

Contributors are individuals who actively participate in the project by submitting pull requests, reporting issues, participating in discussions, and contributing to the project's goals. Contributors are encouraged to adhere to our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and to follow our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for overseeing the project's development, reviewing and merging pull requests, managing issues, and ensuring the overall health and quality of the project. Maintainers are selected based on their significant contributions to the project and their commitment to its goals and values.

### Governance Body

Our project may have a governance body consisting of maintainers and other key stakeholders. The governance body is responsible for making high-level decisions about the project, resolving disputes, and ensuring that the project remains aligned with its goals and values.

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of conflicts or disputes within the project community, we encourage individuals to attempt to resolve them amicably through respectful communication and collaboration. If conflicts cannot be resolved informally, individuals may escalate the issue to the project maintainers or governance body for further discussion and resolution.

## Amendments

This governance document may be amended from time to time as needed to reflect changes in the project's structure, goals, or community. Proposed amendments may be discussed and approved through the project's decision-making process outlined above.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and we look forward to collaborating with you!
